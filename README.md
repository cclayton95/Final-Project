Welcome to ClaytonEMR! This Electronic Medical Record system serves a goal of being a simple EMR capable of collecting basic patient information, storing, and printing said information.

Instructions for this system are straightforward - To use the EMR, simply fill in all entry fields with patient information. 
Please take note that this system allows you to enter insurance plan information, and also choose whether or not this plan is currently
active or not. This allows for storing of plans that are may be on hold for any reason, and check at a glance if insurance elegibility has been confirmed or not.

Three buttons are present at the bottom of the operating window. These are as follows:

Discard and Clear Changes:
	This button will clear all fields immediately. This allows for starting a chart over, without exiting the program
Save and Print Chart: 
	This button will save the entered information, and print all chart information
Exit ClaytonEMR:
	This button will immediately exit the EMR.
